That was the one bug that he found, but otherwise he didn't break TigerBeetle's strict serializability. And also what's interesting is what was a first, he added new um nemeses or storage fault injected injectors into Jepsen. If we wrote to a data file on one machine, um he would take that right and move it to another place in the data file or move it onto another machine's data file. So, he was literally playing with the cups. So, so this was just a normal Jepsen test and then now he was also playing with the cups and TigerBeetle

## 00:30

had to survive and it did. Not many people know this, but he actually could also use antithesis. So, he could use their DST against us. Um and he didn't find anything like that. Uh which is the interesting thing. Um he It It was the human. It was Kyle that found all the interesting findings in his report was was pure Kyle. Uh Kyle really gave it everything he could, but ag- again, skill of the human. Uh he was >> Welcome to Software Unscripted. I'm your host Justin Feldman. Today, I'm talking

## 01:00

with Joran Greef, founder of TigerBeetle, which is known for having developed a legendarily reliable open source distributed database for financial transactions. We talk about how they achieved such a high level of quality using things like Zig, deterministic simulation testing or DST for short, their unorthodox tiger style programming style, and even subjecting their database to the also legendary scrutiny of Kyle Kingsbury and Jepsen, which has absolutely dismantled the quality claims of other popular databases in the past, but which earned TigerBeetle a glowing review.

## 01:30

We also get into broader topics of software quality, the economics of open source, and where the real value comes from for software in general.

All right, Yury Gnip, welcome back. >> Hey Hey, Richard. So good to be back. I think it's been been about 2 years.

## 02:30

> > Yeah Yeah, and and something that happened in the last 2 years since since we talked was the Jefferson report coming out about TigerBeetle, which was incredibly impressive because I always thought of Jefferson reports as being something that would just skewer databases. I think about the famous MongoDB example, just left and right, like here's this problem and that problem and this guarantee didn't hold up and that, you know, correctness issue and this security flaw. Uh but yours was not like that at all. I mean, they they did their usual deep dive and uh I was really impressed by the result,

## 03:00

How did you feel about getting that >> Oh I mean, yeah, thanks. I really appreciate it. So, it was I was also really happy. Um I should say I could tell you how I felt during the audit. Um that that was quite something because you you do feel like you you skewer Carl is so good. Uh he has a instinct for for where to go in the African safari to find the lion, you know, to find the bugs. And uh he he was just so good in building a reference implementation of

## 03:30

our state machine. He he did almost the most comprehensive implementation that that he's ever done for any report. Um because he he didn't just try to break TigerBeetle's strict serializability, you know, just to break the consensus. Normally, he achieves that for for almost everything uh because that's that's one of the hardest problems in a distributed system is is is the distributed system so the consensus protocol and and you just have to find a way to break that and you break everything. And

## 04:00

so he checks linearizability and all these things but he actually didn't only try to check that he he tested almost TigerBeetle's entire like product surface area or entire API. And he re-implemented everything in a second independent implementation and and then differential fuzz both. So he did actually find one bug on the read path so it didn't affect your ability. Query engine didn't always return all the results. Maybe the tail would be

## 04:30

less and then it paginated so you'd go back and then you'd get it. So that that was bad enough. That that was the one bug that he found but otherwise he didn't break TigerBeetle's strict serializability. And also what's interesting is what was a first he added new um nemeses or storage fault injected injectors into Jepsen. So while he was running the distributed database like these three cups he was taking the data files and he was moving them around underneath TigerBeetle. So he was corrupting a

## 05:00

TigerBeetle's designed you know one of the first databases to to actually not only make real-time backups but test them and heal them. So in other words it can survive from corruption or recover from corruption. And so Carl was actively if we wrote to a data file on one machine he would take that right and move it to another place in the data files or move it onto another machine's data file. So he was literally playing with the cups. So so this was just a normal Jepsen test

## 05:30

and then now he was also playing with the cups and TigerBeetle had to survive and it did. So he found a a very easy bug in another part of the system but the the core foundations held firm. And I think what's interesting is that we we built everything in TigerBeetle to a very high standard. We didn't take anything off the shelf. So, we built every every line of code is handcrafted, very high standards, tight strict tolerances. And we got to production in 3 and 1/2

## 06:00

years. It was about 4 years by the time Kyle started auditing. Um which is also one of the shortest, you know, durations for shipping something to production. Um and it passed as well. So, he he know he couldn't really break it in the ways that that count. And so, I think yeah, that's just um we weren't lucky, you know, that that's just tribute to Tiger style, the like the philosophy philosophy behind all the methodology behind how we, you know, actually built TigerBeetle.

## 06:30

So, we we didn't just engineer TigerBeetle, we engineered the way we would engineer so that we could pass Jepson, which was that was the goal. So, but yeah, it felt pretty nerve-racking during the audit. There were times when, you know, he thought he found a terrible bug, and we realized that he hadn't. Uh And and so, you have these moments where you're like um Yeah. And he he Not many people know this, but he actually could also use Anthesis. So, he could use their DST

## 07:00

against us. Um and he didn't find anything like Uh which is the interesting thing. Um he It It was the human. It was Kyle that found all the interesting findings in his report was was pure Kyle, and I it's it's one thing to do DST, but the skill is really how good is your verification, how good is your test Um because no no DST harness will give you that. You have to have to write your verifiers, and so that was Kyle's skill.

## 07:30

Yeah. There was one that Anthesis found where they said, "Ooh, data loss across the cluster." And we realized actually they, you know, on on their side, the the Docker they were doing uh we we don't recommend docker but it was doing like a rm dash f you know when you would restart the and well of course that will lead to data loss if you delete the data files in the test harness. But otherwise that I think that was the scariest moment data loss in DST and we realized no. So so even using an advanced DST he couldn't break

## 08:00

And we obviously have our own DST that is all in house. So we every all our own DST from the beginning has been you know also our own. But Kyle really gathered everything he could but again skill of the human he was phenomenal. So >> Yeah. That's what I mean and certainly that particular human has a lot of experience breaking databases in all sorts of fun and exciting ways. So it's it's really impressive especially as I understand it one of his main

## 08:30

things that he goes for is testing your claims. Like you say that it can do all these impressive things. Well let's see if that's true or not. And it seemed like my conclusion from reading the report was he was like yeah actually does. I mean you're claiming some really really strong things and you actually are backing them up in practice. >> Yes. And what what I really loved about his report is not what he said about TigerBeetle but what he said about beast and replication and protocol aware recovery. When you put these two great protocols together they actually work. Like you you you you know they they

## 09:00

and and they give you more availability because you're taking your redundancy through protocol aware recovery and you're not able to recover from storage faults as well and and so Kyle says look you know all these protocols they work and and and here. So I was so overjoyed to see a distributed database for the first time a storage fault model but Kyle's testing this and then he was saying wow I can't wait to move the cups around other databases which but I mean that that breaks everything. So but yeah all all tribute to the you know

## 09:30

the protocols that we used. also I'm you know obviously very impressed by this result and but but I have to wonder, do people ever come up to you and say like, "Hey, you know, maybe you made one of the most resilient, fault-tolerant, distributed databases in history, but couldn't you have been even better if you wrote it in Rust? Wouldn't it have been more memory safe?" People must say things like that to you, >> Or if we wrote it in a memory safe language like JavaScript or TypeScript,

## 10:00

wouldn't have been more safe? Or Ruby, I >> Think of that. Much better. Much better, I mean, what what what what do you say when people bring those things up? >> I would say they're all pretty much memory safe. Okay, one is going to also test concurrency for you, which is a hard problem, but but you know, would would writing TigerBeetle in a memory safe language like TypeScript make it correct? yeah, what what do you think, Richard? >> Well, I mean, my thought would be that

## 10:30

the the types of things that you just described, like for example, Kyle's simulating uh I guess well, not simulating, just like actually creating data errors by moving parts of files around and things like that, that's not really related to memory safety. Um but I can actually think of you know, just taking your example of JavaScript, I can think of examples of where switching from Zig to JavaScript would cause problems because now you have out of memory errors that you can't recover from in the way that you can with Zig because I mean, I happen to know that you have the static never

## 11:00

allocate philosophy. So, you're you're in very, very complete control of all of your allocations, and in Rust you can be, but everything down to the standard library in Rust assumes that you have a global allocator that can allocate whenever, and you would have to >> leaving you down the path of you not going to, you know? So, yes, you can, but you going to the ecosystem going to lead you down the other path. So, I >> I mean, that's yeah, so like in if you were using Rust, you would need to fight against the way that Rust wants you to program in order to have the like memory

## 11:30

not just safety but memory I don't know reliability guarantees that you have around like handling out of error conditions. Like concretely I would bet that if you had used Rust or you had used JavaScript that Kyle would have been able to find ways to break TigerBeetle or cause it to go down by exploiting out of memory errors by by doing things that would intentionally run it out of memory and I think there's there's a pretty good chance that he would have succeeded in that because you're just really playing whack-a-mole if you're

## 12:00

kind of anything other than Zig or maybe >> It's not I would agree. I actually hadn't considered that that that the out of memory cuz we did you know explicitly set out that we don't want to have out of memory that that is not okay for a mission critical database that it could crash because it can't statically allocate resources and I think what I think what's also interesting is there's a few things. So I think people put too much pressure on a language for correctness. I think

## 12:30

and and and separately they conflate memory safety with security with correctness. The three are totally different. So you know I think the most horrible security exploits today are in the NPM ecosystem. So you know I I did some hacking in white hat in a past life and if someone gave me the choice here's some C code here's some JavaScript find a P0 bounty I'm going for JavaScript. I'm going for the memory safe language that has NPM 600 dependencies show me show me that

## 13:00

one I will find the supply chain attack. Well I'll try but that would be my bet you know I would I would invest my time there and today I think that's where most of the security risk is. Things have moved on you know and supply chain attacks are going to be the next swing of the pendulum and how do we solve those? And and I think the other thing is yeah so people put too much pressure on a language for correctness. They conflate that with memory safety and they conflate memory safety with security. Correctness is far bigger than

## 13:30

memory safety. So, in a distributed system like TigerBeetle, local memory safety actually you what you caring about is end-to-end correctness and global safety of the global system as a whole. So, you have multiple computers. So, yes, you could have something that can verify that one local component, you know, it doesn't use after free. But how do you verify that the global distributed system is not doing the equivalent of use after free and like,

## 14:00

you know, split-braining the log, um reusing and, you know, a prepare slot for something else. That's a much harder problem and Rust can't protect you from that. It's It doesn't guarantee distributed memory safety. Uh you know, in the logical sense of the system as a whole cuz really what memory safety is is my state machine, the state will not be corrupted, you know, and and and yes, other properties like we're not going to be able to do a physical exploit. But I think the other thing that people

## 14:30

conflate when they say memory safety is they're not clear. Do they mean physical memory safety or logical or both? And most Rust developers I chat to don't realize it doesn't give you logical memory safety. It gives you only physical memory safety. So, what do we mean by this? Um so, what you know, what was some of the most expensive security exploits in >> Um I'm going to guess off the top of my head the Log4j one uh from a couple years ago was one.

## 15:00

> > Okay. Okay. Yeah, I think you win. But I I was thinking of Cloudbleed, Heartbleed. So, logical buffer bleeds, you know, where where a hacker is trying to read sensitive data and your sys- your server is saying to them, "Well, you can read my sensitive data. You don't even need a physical memory exploit. You can just do a logical memory exploit by telling my software logically to read from a buffer from the wrong offset. You know, and Rust would have prevented I believe it would have prevented Heartbleed, but it wouldn't prevent all buffer bleeds cuz

## 15:30

many of them are just logical reuse of a buffer once initialized. So, you know, it's a think of like a file format decoder where the hacker can force arithmetic overflow to get the decoder to read from the wrong part of the buffer and expose sensitive So, that that's often, you know, what happens, but a lot of people don't realize that and I don't mean to pick on Rust here. I just mean to elevate that our understanding of these things cuz these are unknown unknowns. So, we're all chanting security, security, but nobody

## 16:00

is talking about buffer bleeds or are we talking about physical or logical memory safety or checked arithmetic. And checked arithmetic is so so so critical if you if we really care about security, you have to have it enabled by default in safe builds. And every time I ask for a a Rust developer this, you know, do you have, you know, do do your safe builds enable I'm I'm sure. You know, or or or some of them will know, but actually by default in a safe build it's disabled. And what

## 16:30

people don't know is is in Zig and positively speaking, I think I I I I'm sure that Rust will change this default and they really should. In safe builds it must be on. In Zig checked arithmetic is enabled because it's highly dangerous that you just let integers wrap around with no consequences cuz that hackers will always you know, abuse that. I would just love to use some of the work I used to do was all all about how do you detect this as zero days. You can detect a whole lot of zero days if you just look for checked arithmetic exploits. It's it's actually quite easy.

## 17:00

And that that'll actually, you know, static analysis will help you find memory exploits, too, but So, these are like my This is kind of what I've learned think I love Rust, too, you know, and our team love Rust. So, Matt Clark on the team will say, you know, Zig and Rust. And he also tried hard mode Rust. You know, how how can you use Rust for static allocation? Of course, you can. And shortly after that, he joined TigerBeetle. He loved Tiger Star static allocation. So, just to be clear, both

## 17:30

languages very positive, but I do think as an industry we need to stop chanting and and start thinking. Checked arithmetic, yes, enabled by default in safe bolts. Let's not conflate safety, correctness, security. They're all different fields. And also safety is more than correctness. So, correctness just means that software is correct. It works. Safety is about what happens when it isn't correct. Does it kill people or does it shut down safely?

## 18:00

That in my mind, that's that Some people will have different definitions, but I see safety as what happens precisely when there are bugs. What does the software do? And that's so important when you're in a mission-critical domain. So, there was a nice capital I don't know if you if we want to go there, but you know, the whole company went bankrupt because their software It was correct most of the time and when it wasn't, it wasn't safe. And it it's it's spent all their money. They went bankrupt in in millions of dollars

## 18:30

cuz the system couldn't autonomously shut down when it entered you know, when it violated invariants. So, these these are kind of getting to all the Tiger Star things, but I do think, you know, in a distributed system, if you look at all the invariants, there's thousands of invariants that all have to hold or Carl Kingsbury will break strict traceability. Like, all a thousand of these invariants, there's 10 There we have about 10,000 in TigerBeetle. If one

## 19:00

of them breaks, Richard, Carl's report, the finding would have been different. And the I think the for me, the what I learned through this is that only one of those a thousand is memory safety. So, so he he he only has to break any one of a thousand and that and the hacker is through. And memory safety is one of a thousand in terms of correctness. And yet, that you know, so our our view of correctness I think is too small. It needs to be bigger as an industry. And safety is far more than correctness. So,

## 19:30

Carl actually found mint quite a few bugs in TigerBeetle. They were awesome. Where he could get TigerBeetle to shut down. And the interesting thing there is that if TigerBeetle hadn't shut down, he would have had himself a correctness bug. He would have broken our strict traceability. But because TigerBeetle realized, "Hmm, some someone's doing something weird, you know." They they they're running the database on its head upside down or something. Like they've turned the cups. Uh TigerBeetle could pick that up and actually shut down safely. So, he could

## 20:00

he he could get it to do that in about five different ways and most of them the next thing he would have had is P0, but but we stopped it there. So, that's what I kind of love about Tiger style is is, you know, it's there's memory safety a thousand times bigger as correctness and about 10 times bigger that big circle is safety. And that that's kind of what uh yeah, how how I see things. But back to you. >> Hey, I mean, it's so interesting how different projects have different

## 20:30

tolerances for different levels of safety. Like you mentioned the NPM ecosystem is full of exploits. People are actively pursuing them. They've found you can make a lot of money doing But of course, a lot of projects are using choosing to do that anyway. A lot of greenfield projects knowing that that's that's an issue or just like "Yeah, well, we're not as worried about that as we are about, you know, not shipping on time or something. And we think this ecosystem's going to be what, you know, gets us to ship fastest." I might personally disagree, but I can understand them making different trade-offs compared to you making a

## 21:00

database that's literally for financial the costs of And it's first of all, attackers are going to be highly motivated to try to figure out some way to exploit the system cuz they like money and and if they're successful then the consequences are very serious. So, you need to if you want to become a critical piece of infrastructure for lots of institutions, you have to take things that seriously >> if you want to do a good job. That's that's what it means. >> But even as a company, you know, even a

## 21:30

few years ago when people were joining for an internship on day zero, people are trying to hack them. They're getting highly targeted fishing um from me. It it's quite something. So, now when people join the company, we have to warn them like look, you're going to be fished on day zero or even before. So, it's it was pretty interesting like that would not have expected so soon, you know, but this was even just going into production and already that happens. So,

## 22:00

Yeah. So, I guess that's the the question is like, you know, does quality take longer or you know, maybe we've got different trade-offs around time, you know, to delivery of projects and so therefore we use NPM. What what are your thoughts? >> Well, I mean, for me personally, I actually have a personal no NPM policy in general. Like if I'm making a website, I'm just like the first rule is just don't even install NPM on your system, you know, it's uh I don't think it's worth it. I'm sure a lot of people disagree with me about that. Um

## 22:30

and that's >> I'm happy to agree with you. Pretty but but must stand here next to him. >> They can just agree with both of us. >> Um but mostly just because like you mentioned, I mean, there is this whole cultural thing about the ecosystem that I think just causes more bugs and performance problems than it pays for. Uh you know, what you get out of the box has a quality problem that to me is more serious than the benefit of having so much in the box. Um >> But others may disagree.

## 23:00

I'm curious about uh like so you know you TigerBeetle is open source and you mentioned you know you have interns, you're hiring and things like that. Uh so like what is the what pays for all that? Uh is it since you know it is open source, is that you helping companies install and adopt it like consulting or how's that work? >> So we we operate TigerBeetle for people. Um smaller startups, it's you know open source is too expensive for them. It's like Goldilocks. So they they love open source, they want to be able to run it

## 23:30

locally on their development machine, but you know to spin it up, to upgrade it, to set up monitoring operations, You know, one of multiple systems and you want to get to market and build a product and iterate and like so do you really want to you know 24/7 SRE team as a you know as a young company? Uh it's too expensive and you know with special skills just for one database. Um you're going to use like like Superbase, you know, and and we have a startup program

## 24:00

and we'll just talk to us. Half an hour later it's up and running. Like and now your engineers which are cost a lot, they can focus on products. So you know what differentiates your company. You know, most companies were not incorporated to have SRE teams to run TigerBeetle. That's not the mission of the company. We're going to be TigerBeetle operators. That That's our mission as a company. So we do that and that's what we specialize in. So you know, our customers work directly with our engineers. Our

## 24:30

engineers understand you know, hundreds of thousands of lines of code and they understand the system as a whole in our customers' environments, you know, their business, how that works, their architecture around TigerBeetle. So usually it's not TigerBeetle going down, it's it's Kafka or somewhere else and our engineers can jump in and help with that. But primarily we're operating. So you know, cloud um usage-based pricing and then what we do for enterprises they say well yes we do have SRE teams but

## 25:00

open source I need to pay you because I need 24/7 priority support. If TigerBeetle goes down and and and we're trying to page you it's too late to escalate. We actually want you to page us. That's sort of what our customers say. How can you page our engineering team to let us know that you found a problem maybe beyond TigerBeetle like that that's a blew me away when one of our customers asked for that. They they want us to page them. You know?

## 25:30

Uh um Yeah so so that and then enterprise also needs scale because it's one thing to do like 500,000 transactions a second but where are you storing all of that? You can't store it on replicated NVMe. So they want to archive to object storage and we do you know enterprise connected to object storage. Our principle there is we're a company first. Our technical contribution to the world is TigerBeetle as open source. Um that's different from our product. So our product is TigerBeetle operated at

## 26:00

scale and you can operate TigerBeetle great on on NVMe local replicated but you know how are you going to write a file system driver to do tearing to object storage? That's you know that's what we do as well. So we have a you know TigerBeetle's the tip of the iceberg and then we we working on we have a lot of code um beneath that that connects you you know for petabyte scale. It's really really hard to run you know people do you know hundreds of transactions a second which

## 26:30

which is actually very high scale um or thousands or 10,000 a second and all of them like they they can't trip the the SLAs in terms of latency. Um some some of the SLAs are like 60 milliseconds even for multi-region deployment which is like incredibly tight. So that these are the things that our team work on and solve. Um Yeah we don't talk publicly about customers, but uh yeah, we do have customers and we have a nice little business uh that is growing.

## 27:00

> > Really cool because I mean it So, it sounds like to summarize, you have a mix of open source So, TigerBeetle itself is open source. You do have some proprietary stuff that supports that for specific use cases where a customer says, "I could write this myself as an add-on to TigerBeetle, but I don't want to. Uh I would rather pay you to do that." Um and then separately you also have uh yeah, like SLAs and being on call for them and and stuff like that and and setting things up and monitoring them. I like the

## 27:30

example you gave at the beginning of uh you know, a startup comes to you and and they're like, "Well, we could run this ourselves, but we'd rather pay you." And I think something you're maybe underselling a little bit is if I'm starting a startup where I for what whatever my startup is, I want TigerBeetle. That's that's what makes sense for me on a technical level. Um I would be scared that it's like, "Okay, I know TigerBeetle itself has been vetted by Kyle Kingsbury and Jeff Setted all this and it's you know, it's it's What if I set it up wrong?"

## 28:00

> > You know, I I make one little mistake in my AWS config and now a hacker gets in not because of TigerBeetle, but because of I'm like, "I I don't want that. I want to go to the experts who made this thing and pay them." Um >> the system as a whole and that's So, we, you know, for for big companies we actually fly on site and we sit with the engineers for a week and we accelerate them. Um cuz it that's cheaper for them than to try and like read through the docs of like >> You know, we actually just like, you know, Rafael or Federico or whoever

## 28:30

like, you know, all all our team do this and they literally fly all over the world always going Uh I mean, some of them fly to you know, North America and then immediately to Europe and they do the the world tour. Uh um so, but that that's what our team do is precisely to go and like we do a lot of review because these are big companies, some of the biggest in the world and they're doing migrations like they literally are migrating because they have to because there's nothing that can power this scale but TigerBeetle. So they have to migrate and

## 29:00

they you know it's been 30 years of okay we can't migrate you know this is core but the world is increasing and it's becoming more transactional. Um even humans are doing more transactions we can forget AI and quantum stuff but there's just everything is becoming faster and so um they they have to migrate and this is what our team help with them take them through that journey and some of these projects take a year and then we get them to production like some of the biggest um

## 29:30

you know um brokerages or you know in in in a country you know like the second biggest you know and then and then they're on on TigerBeetle so it's pretty cool or you know some of the biggest wealth management companies for a country so the whole country has their savings with this company and and all of those numbers are you know being tracked with TigerBeetle so it's it's it's a lot of um responsibility that's um so but we we love that that's our duty

## 30:00

you know so >> Yeah and I think it's interesting that if you look at your sort of success story of making a company that can be very easily it sounds like self-sustaining in terms of financials and being able to pay for people and you moved into an office space congratulations and you know you're hiring interns and >> It's a small it's a small office there's you you cuz we're a remote global company so you you seeing here space for three people just this little the glass is not ours you know >> So we >> Well but I mean like in contrast I've

## 30:30

also heard some stories of oh you know companies built around open source products that are shutting down or laying people off and and you're going in the opposite direction and one observation I would make is that everything you just told me about how the business side of this open source enterprise works is that you're doing something that's very, very hard. And it's not something that people can just pick up off the shelf and and say like, "Oh, I'll just use this." Not because you've made it hard, but because the stakes are very high. Like you're you're doing something that's very valuable. You've open sourced it, which is great,

## 31:00

but it's not like just the fact that it exists as an open source thing, you know, means that the rest is easy for people. Um whereas a lot of other open source projects, people look at that and "How is it that there can't be a self-sustaining business around this? It's so popular." But to me, it actually seems like that's maybe looking at the wrong dimension. It's not so much that it's popular as as it is like, "Well, if it's used by a lot of people, but it's very easy to use and there's there's no, you know, benefit to having an expert help you out with it, well, in some sense, it's like, how could there

## 31:30

be a business around that? I'm not saying that it's impossible, just rather that it's it's it's not as natural a fit as it is for something like this where the stakes are really high, the cost of a mistake is really high, and uh and and the expertise required to do it do it really, really well is also very high. >> Right. That's right. And yes, you you actually want to create value for people. Um you know, I never like to use Some people say capture the market. I hate that phrase. You want to serve the market, serve the community honorably at

## 32:00

a profit. And that's great. Like business is wonderful thing on the right basis. And I think the best business has this basis. Serve honorably at a profit. And and that's sustainable, and then you can invest, and things come out in the open source, and a lot of our code is not open source. So, people see the Apache two target beetle, but some of that the code that isn't open source is you know, if an enterprise were to need it from us, it's kind of like the equivalent of like, "Let's write our own

## 32:30

ZFS." But that's the kind of decision you would definitely get fired for. Like if if going to write your own object storage driver, like you will get fired. Like um absolutely. So, like don't you know you So, I I I think it it's it's pretty This is the value that we bring is we bring incredibly um you know durability is sacred for enterprise. If you mess this up, you know, if you're writing your own um NVMe drivers, um you know, let us do that for you. Don't Don't try and have

## 33:00

your SRE team now get so excited that they're going to write this themselves. Um cuz you will get fired. And And that that is our values. You know, this is our job. Like that is we what what we do. Um so, I kind of I kind of always love that saying, "Nobody got fired for IBM." But people certainly got fired for writing their own file system drivers. And that And that you know, that is part of our values. So, um We had Yeah. Yeah. Um Yeah. So, I think that's the thing with business and open source. But if you have If you have business motivating you

## 33:30

and propelling your team and your team love to serve honorably at a profit, all then what is great is that that the business motive actually drives the engineering motive. And now you've got a healthy business motive. And now your engineering motive is, "Well, absolutely we're not using NPM. Cuz we we we care. You know, we we we want to give quality." And I should also say like I did grow up in JavaScript. I'm really thankful. I

## 34:00

learned a lot. I I was writing um Rhino on the JVM before Node came out cuz I was absolutely convinced the world would move to server-side JavaScript. I I thought this is inevitable. So, so I was doing that. And then Node.js came out. And Hacker News and on day one I was in the community. But over about 10 years, Richard, then I realized it's actually too hard for me. My skills are not good enough to write a production API in Node.js. It is impossible for me. Other people can do it, but I'm not good enough. There's

## 34:30

just no ways I can written write an API with explicit limits that can handle overload, you know, DDoS and stuff. I know I mean I was doing stuff where you like patching the V8 GC to try and make an API in Node.js production grade. And I was doing stuff like Martin Thompson in Java, you know, where you you're not even using pointers in JavaScript. You have one big gigabyte buffers with you and you're doing pointer arithmetic in the buffer. And at some point you just realize I would love

## 35:00

a language with pointers. Please. Can I just have first-class pointers? We have first-class functions, but now please just first-class It's just going to be easier for writing stuff at scale. And so Yeah, so I and I think now I think a lot of the reason why people went into NPM was because the tooling in C was so terrible. Like how do you compile a C And then okay, we'd be you know, we're going to rather spend the next 10 years of our life writing JavaScript than trying to figure that problem out.

## 35:30

Um but that that problem isn't a problem anymore. Zig is so easy, you know, you download the compiler and you write some code. You can cross-compile a binary for Windows or whatever obscure Um it's wonderful. So these days I think the best language to be learning It's so simple and powerful great power to weight ratio. I would say Zig, you know, I love Rust. I I love JavaScript at the time, but Zig for me is really like the sweet spot of power to weight. Um and it's I think it's a healthy start for

## 36:00

young engineers to learn Zig. You're going to get the You're not going to be learning half of programming but without pointers. You're going to be learning the whole of it. Um so I Yeah, I'm I'm excited for Zig for how it can teach the next generation of coders. It's It's so readable like Python, you know, or TypeScript. Um Uh and yeah, but I think we need to build these mental models. So anyway, I wax lyrical about this. So,

## 36:30

> > Yeah, well, this calls to mind, I mean, going back to our previous discussion about sort of there being like levels of needs and and things around, you know, security, but also maybe scale. I'm willing to bet that pretty much nobody who has used Node.js and is listening to this has ever tried, "Hey, for my server-side API, I'm going to allocate a giant gigabyte array and, you know, manually do memory management inside of that." Like you just mentioned earlier. But I would assume that the reason that like what drove you to that is that you

## 37:00

were doing things the normal way and you just ran into production problems. Is that right? >> Absolutely. Huge production problems like 2-day outages to and they were not the fault of my code. It was V8's GC that was pausing for 2 minutes. Uh literally and I that was the hardest thing cuz you think, but my the platform must be, you know, it's like kind of like you're doing mathematics and suddenly you realize that all the first principle axioms are actually wrong cuz you you you always assume the axioms are Uh and suddenly you discover, "Oh, the the GC doesn't work and now there's

## 37:30

nothing my code can do." You like you have to like hide stuff from the GC. So, yeah. So, um that that was my experience. I ran so far, you know, even in Node.js you can have memory fragmentation. That's just a real problem if you just use Zlib. I don't know if it's been fixed, but um yeah, there was I found some wonderful performance issues in Node.js. Yeah. I I believe the the the CPU pool is still four threads

## 38:00

or the the thread pool is still four threads. And so, if you're doing DNS lookups, those are being dropped into that four-thread pool. It's so easy for an attacker just to get your system to resolve some poisoned DNS um resolver that that will be a tarpit and just consume all four threads of your application. And and now you're DDoS'd and people would never know that this is happening, you know, you just got some tidy DNS and blocking your whole thread pool, which is only sized to four. I don't

## 38:30

know if that has changed, but I mean, I gave I There were so many issues. Please, let's a thread pool should could should we should be able to size it for CPUs, and let's let's separate IO DNS from CPUs cuz the runtime, the latencies are It's like racing Formula 1 cars and you know, and trucks on the same racing track. It's not a good idea. Let's have two racing tracks, two thread pools with different performance characteristics. But, the whole even like Fedor Indutny, he was so awesome. I mean, they were They were great people in Node. So, I'm

## 39:00

I am thankful to it. It was a phenomenal learning experience of how not to write production software, you know, and and many of us benefited and we had jobs and great. But, I don't I I think it's a cul-de-sac like um And and for example, Fedor Indutny, he showed you could double network performance for Node.js. Uh and that that PR I think it you know, it didn't go anywhere and and it should have. Like, he was doing great work. And all it was was bring your own buffer. If you want to read from the kernel's TCP

## 39:30

receive buffer, in Node.js, you have great buffers. You know, the API should allow you to bring your buffer, receive into it. And he did a PR to to show that this could it could double performance for the world's Node.js servers. And it never happened, you know, and um and I mean, there's reasons because the project is is is not going to change. You know, these are fundamental changes, so it's too late now. Um but, yeah. So, I think Yeah, it's just um I I ran away from that experience and I

## 40:00

looked for a language where can we just do something as simple as bring a buffer to receive into intrusive memory that you know, in intrusive memory path, you know, but it's bring your own buffer, you know, BYOB. And And Zig was perfect for this cuz you could not only bring your own buffer, but bring own standard, your own allocator to the standard lib. The standard lib isn't going to use globals. And you think, "Wow, like a standard lib that doesn't have I mean, surely this is like put, you know, programming 101 is don't the standard lib shouldn't be reaching out to a

## 40:30

global somewhere." >> But almost all standard libs are broken like this. And finally, Andrew is like like he really cares. He's like, "Well, this is a very simple problem, but it's very important to fix. Let's, you know, bring your own allocator. Now let's bring your own IO." So I I was so happy for Zig and so thankful. And I I loved C as well. And C, you know, you had all these knife edges. You like walking blindfolded on the cliffs of Dover, and you're going to fall off. Um and Zig started adding

## 41:00

Um obviously, you can still jump over the guardrail if you like. Um you know, the borrow checker would you. But if you really want to jump over, you can. But Zig, you pretty much have guardrails. Um and there's ways that you can design Yeah, I think this is the other thing. Um the problem with all the memory issues are really a design problem. So this is coming back to where we you know, we we began is that people put too much on a language for correctness. It's kind of like saying "I'm going to

## 41:30

choose the language I grew up speaking as a baby from my parents. I'm going to choose whether I speak English or Russian cuz if I can speak Russian, I'll become Nabokov. And if I speak English, I can become Hemingway. So I'm expecting, you know, English to make me a great writer." Um and obviously, you know, that logic doesn't hold. And we're as programmers, yet we do the same thing. I'm expecting, you know, to program in JavaScript memory safe cuz it's going to make me secure and correct. Um and JavaScript absolutely is not going

## 42:00

to do that because correctness, I think, is not a language property. It's a design property of the system as a whole end to end. It's a you know, in a distributed system, it the language doesn't even span the machines. Uh the compiler doesn't know about them, so there's no way it can help you. So, it's it's a it's really a design problem, and you have to think of methodology. So, I think the way we get to correctness is language being readable, explicit like Zig, checked arithmetic enabled by default, yes, great, bounds checking.

## 42:30

Rust too is has got phenomenal it does bring to the table, but it doesn't stop there, and I think that's where we make the mistake as the industry is we have these language wars, and actually we're forgetting that correctness is a systems thinking problem end to end design. Are we writing fuzzers? Are we doing differential testing? Are we doing deterministic simulation testing? Do we have assertions? Um all these things, so that that's the stuff that really makes for safety uh

## 43:00

and correctness. Yeah. I think. >> Uh I mean I I as someone who likes languages a lot, I totally agree with what you're saying. I mean, it's it's definitely not the case that you can just pick a language off the shelf and be like, "Oh, this is the correctness language. Well, now I will have correct code." Um at best a language can help you with that. It it it >> Like languages a lot, Richard. I've never met anyone who knows more languages than you. >> Oh, I have. >> I'll I'll name Deitch Aditya Zero off

## 43:30

the top of my head. He definitely got me into languages and and knows more than I do. Um Phil Wayne also probably knows like a longer tail of languages that I that I know. But >> As he was telling me about, you know, his look look he's been going into all the history of go to and all the variants of that. I don't know. but I mean, I I think an interesting parallel that to your comment about English and Russian is um you talked about how like in Zig, you have in the

## 44:00

standard library this design invariant where you don't allocate, you just say, "If I need to allocate memory on the heap, then give me an allocator. It'll allocate stack memory. That's it. Uh and and also it now it it also is the same with IO. It's like, "Hey, tell me how to do IO. I'm not even going to assume that I know what the file system is or that there even is a file system." Things like that. Uh Both of which are really cool, useful invariants. And uh it reminds me of functional programming in the same way where there's this culture around, you

## 44:30

know, even in languages that don't have it as a first-class language guarantee, they'll still say like pure functions in the standard library. That's as much as possible really really avoid any kind of side effect. Um And and one way you can look at those as as sort of two sides of the same coin is that uh you know, when we talk about pure functions, um there's a little bit of hand-waving that has to happen because CPUs don't have a concept of functions, let alone pure functions. What CPUs do is they read

## 45:00

registers and mutate registers. It's just side effects for days. So, there's you know, this this all has to be sort of an abstraction on top of that. It's it's a conceptual pure function. Um and similarly, when you think about, you know, allocating memory and things like you can pretend that allocation just always works and always succeeds and is always fine. But of course in practice, that's not the case. there's a similar limit when it comes to stack memory because even in Zig, like, you know, for practical purposes, you do

## 45:30

kind of assume that you're not going to run out of stack memory, but you could. Not not entirely real. Well, we you know, we we're very careful with recursion and that, but we wish we could be more disciplined about this in how we, you know, actively measure our stack usage. But um >> I was actually wondering if that uh if you have any special tools around that to try to create to go from something where it's like, "Well, this shouldn't happen, but it theoretically could." Because I mean, in

## 46:00

theory, if someone could find a long enough chain of calls, even if there's no recursion involved, where the functions are not getting inlined and you don't have enough registers, even if there is inlining, where you have to go to the stack, and the only possible way that this code code can compile is if it compiles to something which at runtime could potentially, theoretically, blow the stack. What do you think? >> Uh you got me there. No, we're with you. We we have the same like desire and I

## 46:30

think Zig is working towards this cuz uh you know the the the early async version, it was pretty cool how you could get a frame, you know, and and see, "Oh, this is the, you know, the size of the stack." And obviously, we we don't use that in TigerBeetle. We didn't at the time and and the new one we don't. We We do our own callback style because we like to be very explicit about the memory that survives through the the lifetime, you know, of the asynchronous uh function. but we also use very um

## 47:00

our code is very simple, so the control flow is by design is meant to be simple and quite flat. And so, we do know like if there are places where we could get a bit of a chain um or a graph, then those places we we rewrite the style. So, we will use like a state machine where the code also becomes more readable and so that you're not um So, we we approach it with like simplicity, discipline. We We're We're actively aware of this. But um we also don't do recursion um

## 47:30

following, you know, NASA's power of 10 rules for safety-critical code. So, we don't do recursion as well. Um uh and so, we It's not really a problem for us. Um it would be cool if we could like measure and like sort of monitor stack usage and like be decreasing that just as like a a waste thing, but um it's not a We We also run our simulators. We have a fleet of 1,024 cores dedicated. They're in Finland, so

## 48:00

they've got, you know, renewable It's very cold place, and so the the cores are running 24/7, and each one of them runs the Vapur, our own in-house deterministic simulator that we've always used. That That's the thing that really got us to production in 3 and 1/2 years, and this simulator runs across 1,000 cores all the time, and a second there there's a speed up factor of around 700. So, 1 second on one core is worth 700 seconds,

## 48:30

and we've got 1,000 cores. So, it's like 2,000 years a day of simulated run time in all different ways. And so, I again, if we did have a stack thing, this would probably catch it. I should actually ask the team if we've ever had one. give me 1 second. Hey, Ted. Have we ever had Has Vapur ever caught a stack overflow? >> Don't think Vapur has. >> No. Okay, thanks.

## 49:00

So, yeah, we we've never I mean, we've found hundreds or thousands of bugs, but we've never the fleet has never caught a which actually could also mean that our testing is just not good enough. We should be finding it, but we aren't. You never know, but so Yeah. >> I do remember you in the in your blog post about the Jepson report, you did note that like the one correctness bug was actually something that the fuzzer missed. So, it is possible, right?

## 49:30

> > Exactly. And that that's when we wrote that whole blog post, you know? So, that that was that bug that I referenced in in our query engine where we if you were querying data out, we wouldn't return in a page we wouldn't return all the data. If you went back for the next page, you would get it. But, that that is terrible. So, I told Kyle, "Well done. Like, this is a This is You've broken our correctness on the read path and if you query a database to get data out and it doesn't give you the data, well, it's almost as if you never wrote it in the first place. So, it's

## 50:00

very bad. But, we did we did fix it immediately and and it's fixed and it didn't affect durability. Um Kyle thought it wasn't so bad. I said to him, "No, this is horrible." So, Yeah, and that we we had I think three fuzzers and it made it through all of But, that was why we employed Kyle because we want an independent auditor um to find So, I you know, I think you and I we we were in person in New York in in uh '24. Kyle was there as well and

## 50:30

we went for coffee after that uh with Oscar Wickstrom who's working on uh Bombadil now with Antithesis. But, but um Kyle Yeah, Kyle was there at coffee and I actually said to Kyle, like, "You know what, kid, can we pay you and maybe you can help us find bugs?" So, we we're very happy like all the bugs he found and we'll do it again with him because he's he's good at finding bugs. Um >> Yeah, I I want I often wonder if, you know, there's all this talk about large

## 51:00

language models making people able to get stuff off the ground faster and a lot of the rhetoric around that kind of reminds me of the NPM stuff where it's like um well, you know, you can get stuff off the ground faster as long as you're okay with the downsides being quality, performance, security, et cetera. Um and I'm not really excited about that personally. Obviously, a lot of other people are and I'm I'm sure they will make money doing it. But, uh and and probably lose some money some catastrophic outages, too. However,

## 51:30

> > There's some big market pressures, you know, as the as the valuations of some of these companies correct, like um some I I I kind of think of these things as like, you know, additive increase, multiplicative decrease, like TCP congestion control. Uh capital is flooding into the market and at some point someone, you know, people start paying twice as much for engineers as they really should be like half a million dollars and then the market realizes this and then it crashes and then goes up again and eventually we realize like, oh, LLMs are a thing but maybe, you know, we were a little bit

## 52:00

too hasty. Uh tribute says, don't don't be hasty. Uh but so I I'm sure there's value but it like any market it will have to correct and so that'll happen too. But yeah, sorry back to you, Richard. >> I I get uh frustrated with what I see as mismatches between rhetoric and reality of which there are many right now and one of the like big top line ones is I just ask myself like of the software that I'm using that I see personally as just thinking as an end user not as someone who makes software but just as

## 52:30

someone who uses software like what trends in output have I seen and over the past like 3 years and you know, as soon as I say this people are like, well, anything that was before November 2025 doesn't count because that's an Opus 4.5 came out and we crossed the threshold and like okay, we'll see. Um but I mean, I have definitely the only trend in output that I've noticed has been uh decrease in quality. I I've noticed software getting buggier and that that trend had already existed but it definitely feels like it's accelerated in the last few years.

## 53:00

> > Are we being autonomously worse at quality? We we were humanly bad at quality and now we're like autonomously really bad, you know? >> Uh it it I mean, it it seems to be accelerating that problem but I also have not seen this acceleration in like releases. I have not noticed that like new features or at least not features that I notice or care about coming out faster. Um like I I I complained about this on Twitter and and someone responded uh with some examples that they had noticed of uh software that I also use and I was like, okay, I mean,

## 53:30

those are new features. I didn't know they I kind of looked looked them up. I'm like, I don't like I'm going to use any of these but okay, fair enough. That I mean, they did they did ship them, I guess. Uh so maybe that's a, you know, perception problem of mine but I don't know. When I talk to people, I don't hear people saying things like "Software is getting so much better. Software is getting I'm so much happier with my software." Um so, if that's the output of the system, how many how much does it matter how many PRs per day you're landing if you're not getting to the output of people being happier with the

## 54:00

> > I'm so glad you say. I was thinking about this this morning. I think as an industry, we're optimizing the wrong variable. And when that lands, that like all this hype, billions of dollars investment, we're optimizing the wrong variable, and it's just basic economics. Why why is software valuable to the world? It's because you can write a piece of code once and sell it to the whole world, and you know, you created um the basic

## 54:30

compiler, and then DOS, and Windows 3.1, 95, and durable gates, cuz you you latched onto this idea of software can be a scalable business, cuz you write something valuable for many people, and they will run it for many years. So, I kind of think of course you get bespoke software. You get you get agencies that do WordPress websites that are ad hoc and custom. So, I'm not talking about bespoke software, cuz that isn't really valuable. You know, if you if you're creating bespoke software for people, you're you're going to be paid for your

## 55:00

time, always. And in that industry, for sure, LLMs, they're going to take your job away. So, then you won't even be paid, you know, um I think that I I agree with that, and I think that's great, because now we're going to Yes, we're going to get all this bespoke software. Wonderful. But the world of software that I that you and I I think are really interested in is software that has many users, so you, number of users. how many users are there? There's a lot of users, so it's the whole world using the software. It's like infrastructure software, Linux, or whatever, you know,

## 55:30

SQLite. Um everyone's using it, so a lot of you, um and then for a lot of tea, they're going to use it for many years cuz this stuff is infrastructure. It's got a long half-life. Postgres 30 years old, you know, MySQL also basically my SQLite not far. Um, so these things have a long half-life. Big big tea, big you. Um, and performance is very important, you know, and safety is very important. And so you multiply these things and then you you

## 56:00

don't want to have production outages cuz that is huge cost. So, as a developer, I have a certain hourly rate. Um, but if I write software with big you and big tea and I I break the whole for a day, that cost is way more than my hourly rate. So, if uh, and I I think this is the economics that everybody is missing is that software is valuable because it's scalable because software is eating the world, you know, that that famous saying. And the the world is eating

## 56:30

software. Um, but the world actually wants the software to taste good, you know, and and if it isn't, that's bad because now software can be highly scalable in a good way. It can also be very dangerous in a bad way because you don't want to have blue screens of death because or, you know, your software your operating system gets slower and slower every day and it gets viruses and whatever and then you switch to Apple um, or and or then you switch to another system. Sorry to mention product, but like then you

## 57:00

that has a cost too. And so kind of I think with software the lesson when you to learn is that ambition bites the nails of success. So, as developers we we think of our own productivity and that's the wrong variable to optimize. It If I take a day to write something or if I spend an hour extra and get rid of blue screens of death for the whole world, I mean that hour, what is an hour amortized over 30 years of production usage? It's free. It didn't cost anything. And I this is the thing with

## 57:30

software. So, development cost developers are not expensive. They're only expensive if you're a WordPress agency, then developers are expensive and they will be replaced. But, if you're in any kind of business that's creating value in the world and serving many users for a long time, big you, big T, developers are are not expensive. They're a linear uh salary creating an exponential asset. And so, it's not about linear cost of development because you can take 10% longer relative to the exponential value

## 58:00

creating uh you know, if you take 10% longer and add an exponent, it's way worth it. So, th- this is just basic economics that everybody's saying, you know, LLMs are going to make you code faster. I th- they they forgot like why did we get into software? It's not It's not about our time, it's about the users' time. Serve the community honorably and profit. Don't don't try and So, I think we you know, myself as a developer, I try to get more and more And it it was like a trap, you know, I I

## 58:30

I started writing higher-level languages. I thought they'd make me more productive. And now it's getting to the point where it's like, well, you Node.js here cuz so productive. Not even Node.js now, you're writing English, you know? You'll be very productive. You can write in English. And at a point, I'm like, no, I realized that, you know, I actually want to do things in the most direct way possible. I want to be explicit. So, I would rather write my prompt in Zig. Thank you very much. I want to be explicit on what I want. It's easier for me just to go directly, you know, um because it it you know, Target

Beetle didn't take long to get the design and the the basic thing working. Took like a month. The first prototype took 5 hours, the next one a month, the next one 6 months. And in total, it was like 3 and 1/2 years to production, and it can power countries. So, 3 and 1/2 years is really like someone could do it in in 2 years. It It It's not material, you know? But But, I think the point is that we did it faster than anybody else, also. So, we didn't take longer, we got higher quality in less time with Tiger

## 59:30

Star, but I think now I'm, you know, I can carry on, but I think I think LLMs are exciting when people realize the variable to optimize is quality across all the users across T. Um that that I I would love to see LLMs being used to break software. So, people are thinking of it as constructive. I I love using them in a destructive way. So, I will write to talk, for example, and I'll say to the LLM, "Tell me what sucks. Like, what's really bad? What are people going to misunderstand? What am I

## 01:00:00

missing? What are my unknown unknowns?" And there, like, hallucinations don't matter because if it finds a bug, it finds a bug. So, so I Yeah, I think that's the interesting thing for LLMs is um is the, you know, in increasing quality and the degree to which it can do that. yeah. And maybe, you know, maybe yes, it will write better than human, but at the end of the day, it's not the writing of the code that distributes systems. It's not the creation of code, also. People have totally missed this. Writing a

## 01:00:30

distributed database, you can do it in a month. The time sink, you will know, Richard, is is the testing, the maintenance. There's all the bugs. So, if you don't have a deterministic simulator, you'll have bugs that take you tears to fix. You know, and um so, yes, LLMs cannot help you there. So, the answer actually both are hearing has been using LLMs to, like, reproduce bug reports and and fix them faster. So, that that is not cool cuz it's, you know, increasing quality, but yeah. These are the This is what I've

## 01:01:00

been thinking about this for a while, you know, what makes software valuable, what do we optimize? so, I think LLMs are exciting, but I think the whole industry has gone down a cul-de-sac. English is not the most productive language for coding. Uh and and coding time, even in our software life cycle, most of the cost is production outages, uh incident reports, you know, fixing things, maintenance, testing, and I would you know, I would love to see that. You know, but but those things you can already solve with DST, which is

## 01:01:30

like autonomous testing that you don't have to use an LLM. So, >> Yeah, I mean, I I would love to see a cultural change in the industry where um people are using LLMs and just in general to try to improve software quality as opposed to just getting lower and lower quality software out the door faster and faster. I I am a little bit optimistic that maybe uh that might just naturally happen because if it becomes so cheap to get something low quality out the door, then you just are not

## 01:02:00

differentiated anymore. So, it's like you you put your low quality thing out in the world at breakneck speeds and everyone's like, "Who cares? There's a trillion of those." And so, the thing that makes you stand out and makes people choose your thing over somebody else's is it feels less frustrating to use. People want to They're like, you know, your your pitch is, "I'm going to take your pain away." You're You're using this low quality thing that's slow, it's buggy, it's unreliable, uh it's confusing, and you're saying, "Look, this will be fast, and it will not break on you. It will be

## 01:02:30

reliable." It and and etc. And at some point people are like, "You know what? I will actually pay a little bit more uh to switch to that because I don't like feeling frustrated. And and maybe at that point we start to see that, you know, what what are LLMs capable of when it comes to quality? And I I love your example of using it to break software because trying to figure out where the problems are, not just in distributed systems, but in all sorts of different types of software, is in a lot of cases a really important part of achieving quality.

## 01:03:00

It's like, if you don't know where your quality problems are until end users slam into them, um there's going to be a lot of frustrated users between you and actually achieving >> So, you also well said, Richard. I like it makes Yeah, it it it it my heart burn, you know? And because I think it's also just basic business sense. Like, what do people buy from us? Do they buy our development time? No, they buy the value, the quality, the experience. Like, that's what we always were selling, you know?

## 01:03:30

There there was someone on, you know, um, someone in the venture circles, you know, online and they said that if your cost of coding goes to zero, what are you selling? But, the the the the problem in their premise there's an assumption that you're selling your cost of coding. And we never were. We should know this stuff. Like, like, and the these, yeah, it it's just phenomenal. It's kind of scary to me.

## 01:04:00

That's why I think there there will be a market adjustment coming because we have really marketed the wrong variable being optimized, you know? We're And actually businesses are value-based. They price according to value, not according to cost. So, if your development cost goes to zero, frankly, it doesn't change the value of your product. It shouldn't. Because otherwise, you've got an economics problem, I think. Um, yeah, it's not it it's the it's the quality of your ideas and your execution. However, you do that, you can use an LLM, but the it's the end result

## 01:04:30

that matters. So, so how can LLMs be part of a better end result? Um, yeah, but I I think I'm just saying the same as you. >> Totally agree. And uh, and by the way, I I know you got to wrap stuff we got to wrap up, but um, I I do want to make sure I thank you because in Rocks rewrite to Zig, we actually use some of your stuff from TigerBeetle. Um, some of your like testing tools and uh, lints and stuff like that. So, thank you for open sourcing all that because we're using it. And we've gotten value out of it.

## 01:05:00

So, we appreciate it. >> Oh, thank you. I'm going to say thank you to you because Rocks is such a is such an incredible project that um, I'm I'm I'm also like, um, I'm flattered that that you folks are using it. So, yeah. And thank you to you also for for investing in Zig and in the ecosystem and spotting a wonderful like it's a big wave, you know, you're you're a surfer and you saw the back you saw the swell coming and you like paddled out. You didn't look for a wave or how many surfers are riding the wave and now I'll

## 01:05:30

paddle out to it, but you you know, we we paddle we saw the swell in 2018 2020 already long ago, you know? And then we like paddle we paddled to it and we met each other up there and we've just had fun riding the wave, you know? And so, uh thanks for being a fellow wave rider. Uh >> Absolutely. I'm I'm excited for uh you know, I I have to be careful about how I talk about Rockwell. We're not quite done with this big rewrite yet because on the one hand it's very exciting and we've got a lot of stuff working and

## 01:06:00

people are starting to use it for things, uh which is great. But on the other hand, I'm also like yeah, if we gave this to Kyle Kingsbury, he would be like this is not even done yet alone uh you know, uh well completely bug-free. So, I I think on the quality front we have a long ways to go with our rewrite, but it's gone very well so far and I I want to live up to that before I start bragging about how awesome it is cuz you know, we got to be honest about where we are. >> Maybe would would you ask Carl if he can audit it for you? >> At some point that would be really cool. I mean it's not a distributed system, so

## 01:06:30

it's not necessarily in his wheelhouse, but um definitely I would be very excited about like finding out are there pathological paths through the compiler that can get it to miscompile something or are there uh ways that you could break some of our security guarantees around like these functions all must be pure. Um you know, we have by design like no FFI and stuff like that. Uh yeah, I mean hopefully we have designed our way out of that, but I'm I don't have so much hubris to think that we you know, could

## 01:07:00

possibly survive a Kyle Jessen audit of our whole whole codebase um without him finding anything. >> like going base jumping that moment, you know, that how you feel as you jump off a mountain. Uh it's terrifying as you engage in, but I would I would encourage you I mean I'm I'm sure you'll do really well. So, I I can't wait. If you could cuz he he does I know it's not distributed, but he he has that instinct, you know, so if if you said him find functions that aren't pure, he would be he would just be excited by that, I >> I mean right now I'm sure he could find

## 01:07:30

any number of problems, but yeah once once we get it to a point where we feel confident in it, I would love to Yeah, maybe I'll reach out to him. I don't know. We don't really have budget for that also cuz we we don't have a business plan at all. It's just we're we're doing it for the love of the game, but uh yeah it would be really cool if if we could get his hands on it once it's at the point where we're like, "Okay, we think it's good now." >> Hopefully Carl is listening and he's like, "Yeah, we all three fellow ST speakers, let's pair it forward and I'll you know, I'll like he he did that interesting report

## 01:08:00

recently on Galera MySQL Galera just you know, of his own for fun cuz he wanted to showed it broke so many almost all of the things you could possibly not get right, you know, in consensus and he >> But I think for you it would be it would be very different, obviously. So. >> I know Jeff has written in closure, so obviously he's a fan of functional programming. So, yeah yeah maybe. Um I would actually love to talk to him. I have any number of things I would ask him, but so maybe we can chat about like making that connection

## 01:08:30

cuz that'd be really fun. He'd be a really fun person to talk to. >> It'd be so refreshing cuz it's so natural like it would be taking his thinking and applying it, you know, to a compiler language and yeah. >> I mean I I I think we're like a couple years away from that being realistic, but I mean we don't even have the LLVM back as of this recording, we don't even have the LLVM back at working yet. So, you know, we have like some machine code back ends, but not LLVM yet. So, definitely not done. Um >> It will be One day you'll look back and

## 01:09:00

it's done and then you've you've made, you know, systematically the right decisions, you've invested in quality. You did the hard thing today, but you really made tomorrow easy. You know, in NPM make today easy tomorrow a nightmare. And you know, and if we're thinking of quality it's like, well, you know, when we reach production let's make that easy and let's make it maintainable, you know, and fast and safe and secure. Rock is pretty awesome. Yeah, Rock I mean Rock is like a shining star like that. The the philosophy around that.

## 01:09:30

> > That's that's that's where we're aimed. I I really you know, I'm pushing hard to get there. So, I I don't want to claim we've gotten there before we have, but that is absolutely where we're going for. So, well, thank you for being an inspiration for you know, like shipping something that actually like not only aimed there, but then got there. And I think the Jefferson report is like a really strong validation of that and tiger style which you know, I know we kind of talked about in bits and pieces, but a lot of people have talked talked to me about how that is just an inspirational read about like

## 01:10:00

how you do software and the things that you're thinking about and like it's not even that you just took NASA's rules and followed them directly. It's like that was just an ingredient into you know, >> like what you came up with to be like what how can we make the highest quality system possible. And so few organizations seem to be aiming that high. It's just really inspiring to see you like aim that high and then actually deliver it and it's it's not just you know, talk and and promises. It's like you implemented it, companies are using it

## 01:10:30

and you know, you've had it vetted by literally the best in the business and came back with a glowing report. Um, really really well done. >> Thank you. Thank you so much. >> I think for me it was just I was thinking, you know, it'll be easier to aim high than to aim low cuz if you aim low you you're going to go even lower. So, I'm just like let's let's aim for like 10,000 X and we just hit 1,000 X, you know, um, >> You can be really really happy what you achieved, right?

## 01:11:00

Great. Well, uh anything else we should chat about before we wrap up? Yeah, people should donate to the Zig Software Foundation. It's uh replacing C. It's a great tool chain to learn systems coding. It's easier than Node.js um to write fast, safe, you know, uh software. It's fun. You can do graphics stuff. What do you think? What else should we plug? Uh download and and run and rock. Uh be part of the rewrite. >> Okay. Here be little Jeffson. Um yeah, and and also uh you you even made a a very nice donation to the Zig

## 01:11:30

Software Foundation, which uh was really cool to see, too. So, you're you're you're not just uh taking the money and using it to hire interns. You're also directly giving back to what made it all >> Yeah, and and yeah, and and that's Zig. Like, Zig is a huge part of TigerBeetle's success. Not only the language. We we couldn't have written TigerBeetle as it is with the same fidelity in any other language. Uh even Matt God, you know, he said he is almost pretty sure we we couldn't have done it as nicely with the same integrity and in Rust um because we do intrusive

## 01:12:00

memory, you know, and we need to program the system as a whole, which includes the kernel, which the borrow checker It It It's It's It's You You have to think of these things as a systems, and it You can't let your thinking stop at the language boundary. It's It's bigger than that. So, we just couldn't have made TigerBeetle in C or Rust or JavaScript, you know. Zig was really what we wanted to express with TigerBeetle. What This was me at the beginning. I I loved C. Um obviously, there's huge problems. I I really liked

## 01:12:30

Rust. I was very interested. And I was I looked into Rust again for TigerBeetle. I decided, "No, the power-to-weight ratio of grammar and what we really need for safety." This is one aspect, and um and then there was Zig, and I'd been following it since 2018, and um I realized, "Oh, this is exactly what I'm trying to express." Andrew's feeling the same. And Barbara Liskov has a quote, you know, she said, "If you want to teach programmers new ideas, you have to give them new languages to

## 01:13:00

think them in." And so like the ideas of Tiger Style, you know, we we needed Zig to think them in. And Zig came along. And so I'm so grateful. Um but yeah, I think that's a good way good place to end is that um yeah, there it's uh we we it it Zig really got things started. And um you know, so Sneddon we we did that donation back to Zig. TigerBeetle did 256,000. Sneddon matched us. And we did this over

## 01:13:30

um over 2 years. So it's half a million dollars. And um uh we paid forward. And I I met Derek, CEO of Sneddon, through Zig. Uh because he was also like you, you know, he saw this well. He saw oh, this is great. It's the same as like back in the day, you know, Ryan on the JVM. And you you know, it's inevitable server-side JavaScript. You know, it's inevitable that someone's going to fix the C tool chain and the C C language. And so you see Zig, you're like, "Ah, this is inevitable. Pedal to the swell."

## 01:14:00

And there's Derek Collison of Sneddon. But not many people know, I think he was the person who was instrumental as a CTO at VMware um who hired Antirez back in the day. You know, remember Antirez was hired by VMware and then he could work on Redis as open source. And like behind that, you know, there was this there was Derek. And you know, now he's doing NATS and Sneddon. So I met him through Zig and said to him, "Like we want to do a donation." We we'd already been doing it every year. We just hadn't told people. And we thought, "Well, maybe we should

## 01:14:30

tell people that we're donating cuz some people need to know how much is donated before they start learning a language that you can learn in a weekend." Uh which is Zig, you know, don't even ask people, "Can I get a job?" Please. Just it's a weekend. Just go and learn it. And And but then anyway, so I I did think well, we should maybe write about this because it will benefit Zig and so I reached out to to to Derek and they matched us and and we want to do more, you know, so

## 01:15:00

yeah, so that's that's all credit to Andrew because you you also want to BDFL actually, you know, you want someone with a conceptual integrity. You don't want committees to run a language. I think that's the biggest risk for any language if the committee will ruin it. ECMAScript 5.000 or whatever, you know, and I can joke like this because it's a committee. I'm not you know, there's no single person whose test I'm criticizing, but you know, Andrew has always he's made such great design

## 01:15:30

decisions and we learn from him. Like whatever Andrew says, we say yeah. If he says no unused that decision has caught bugs in Tiger BL that would have been correctness folks. So you know, programmers think twice if you criticize Andrew Kelly about what he says for, you know, no private fields, unused variables, think he's right, you know, and just take a minute, listen to him, you know, he's got a lot of experience and these things help us too and we, you know, we're fully on board. I love when he breaks the standard lib API because he's he's he's the broom is

## 01:16:00

broken and he's resetting it because you want these APIs to be designed for the next 30 years. Um and you know, the and for us to to update these changes, you know, it's a small PR. We do many PRs a week. Uh what you know, it's it's really easy to to be with Zig, so Yeah, lots of miscellaneous thoughts. Andrew, I Richard, what what are your what are your thoughts there as we come into land? >> I I certainly agree about Andrew's

## 01:16:30

design taste. Like we we were very happy with Zig in general and also, you know, the breaking changes have not been particularly painful for us so far. And and also >> I see you also on the Hacker News commenting about that. You know, when people always ask every time, "Yeah, what about the new and then you speak for for Rock and I Yeah. Not not not thankful for you. >> Every time I talk to Andrew about our Zig experience, he's always like, "Just be unvarnished about it, you know, whatever's good, whatever's bad, just you know, don't don't hold back." And

## 01:17:00

fortunately, I mean, I you know, I have a blog post in the works about our experience that I'm holding off on until we actually cross the threshold of of getting everything working so people can come try it. But yeah, I I I definitely Overall, it's been very positive and I full credit to Andrew for creating the language and doing a good job running it. >> Full full credit. Let's take him out for a gelato next time in Milan. >> Next time we're in person. All right, well, yeah, thanks so much

## 01:17:30

for taking the time to talk to me. This has been really fun and and I'm I'm excited for the future of TigerBeetle continuing to be a a shining beacon of quality in in in the world of software. So, thanks so much. >> No, well, thanks to you, Richard, too. And yeah, thanks for having me. Such a >> That's it for this episode. I hope you liked it.
